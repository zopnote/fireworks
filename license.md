## Open-Source License: GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)

The software and its source code are freely available under the terms 
of the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). Anyone can use, modify, 
and distribute the software under these terms. However, for commercial
usage without the obligations of the GPLv3, a commercial license is available.

## Commercial License Agreement

For commercial usage, an alternative license is available that 
grants the following rights and imposes the following restrictions:

### 1. Permitted Use

The source code and software can be fully utilized in commercial products,
provided that these products do not directly compete with the software itself.
This means that third parties are not allowed to re-release the engine or a modified
version of it as a separate commercial product.

### 2. Ownership and Rights

Products developed using this software are fully owned by their respective 
developers. Apart from the license fee, the licensor has no claims to the 
licensee’s product, revenue, or intellectual property.

### 3. Versioning and License Validity

A purchased license applies to a specific major version of the software, 
including all subsequent updates within that major version. 
Major versions are defined as significant updates that introduce fundamental 
changes to the software. The transition to a new major version is determined 
by the licensor and is indicated by an increment in the first digit of the version 
number. For example, a license for version 2.x covers all minor and patch updates 
within that series (e.g., 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.1, 2.4, etc.), but does not extend to 
version 3.0 or later.

### 4. Copyright Notice

The original copyright must be retained in all files that are part of the licensed 
software. Licensees are not permitted to remove or alter copyright notices present 
in the source code.

### 5. Licensing Fees

The license cost is 5% of the revenue generated from the product once the revenue 
exceeds $5,000 USD. Below this threshold, the licensee can use the commercial 
license free of charge.

### 6. Licensing Flexibility

The licensee is free to choose under which license their product is distributed. 
However, this must not compromise the ownership of the software by the licensor, 
nor invalidate the licensor’s licensing terms.
