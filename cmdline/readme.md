# Fireworks' command-line tooling
Fireworks provides a full development environment to host the development cycle and achieves hot reload for C & Dart.
The cmdline tooling will cache all needed binaries from http and put them into the sdk's cache. 
A Dart SDK, the Clang compiler and CMake will be downloaded.
