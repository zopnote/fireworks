# Global ``presets.json``
The ``presets.json`` file has and should be always in the valid syntax for 
``CMakePresets.json``. Anyway the file is not only used by CMake, 
it is also used by the Fireworks development-build-toolchain and the
module build system provided by the runner (Fireworks cmdline tooling).

**It is the global configuration for all of Fireworks to determine available build targets.**
